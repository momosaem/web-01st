    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets" target="_blank" title="CSS define"><strong>Cascading Style Sheets <u>(CSS)</u></strong></a>
    is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.
    CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]
    CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3]
    This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of
    presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate
    .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.
    <br><br>
    Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles
    for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader),
    and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device. <p></p>

    The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches
    a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
